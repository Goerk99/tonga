title: " šaŋdaq 'glow in the sky (from celestial phenomena or from fire)', dial. saŋɣärt 'марево'"
description:  ДТС 139, Лексика 35, 36. A somewhat dubious root. The words meaning 'mist' may go back to a separate root, PT *čeŋ 'dust'. Other forms (including the late OT one) can be < Mong., but semantics is rather against assuming such a loan.
