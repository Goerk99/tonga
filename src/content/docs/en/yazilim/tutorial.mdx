title: Öğretgi/Öğretge
description: Tutorial -> Öğretgi/Öğretge
---

The word "Tutorial" etymologically comes from the word "tutor" meaning "a private teacher, typically one who teaches a single pupil or a very small group." Can be much or less boiled down to "öğretmen" or "özel öğretmen". The verb "to tutor" is similar in the sense that it conveys the meaning of acting as a tutor.

The suffix "-al" implies relation, someting related to something else.
Example: Latin "annus" meaning year to annual meaning yearly

A similar suffix in Turkish is -ge/-ga which makes nouns from related verbs
bil -> bilgi
yet -> yetki
ver -> vergi

etc. etc.

As such, going from öğret to öğretgi or öğretge appears to make a good amount of sense.

(many words constructed during modern Turkish seems to switch to -gi/-gı from -ge/-ga but I felt -ge just sounded nicer here and there is no real convention anyways.)
