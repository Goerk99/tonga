<strong> 1 to search (through) 2 to ask</strong><br><br>
<strong>Japanese</strong>:  *sunkur-<br>
<strong>Comments</strong>:  EDT 816. Федотов 2, 466-467 derives the Chuv. form < *sōr(a)- 'ask' (v. sub *sṓra), but the initial š- remains unclear in both cases. Because of this, and because of the Hapax nature of the OT form the it is actually not quite clear whether the root *sogra- exists at all. An argument in its favour is the semantic match between OT and Chagatai and the resulting semantic distinction (*'search (through)') from *sōr(a)- 'ask'.<br>
<strong>Russian meaning</strong>:  1 обыскивать 2 спрашивать<br>
<strong>Karakhanid</strong>:  soɣrut- 1 (MK)<br>
<strong>Middle Turkic</strong>:  sora- 1, soraɣaq 'search, perquisition' (Pav. C.)<br>
<strong>Chuvash</strong>:  šɨra- 2<br>
